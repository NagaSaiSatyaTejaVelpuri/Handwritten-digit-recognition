# Handwritten-digit-recognition
This model for "Handwritten digit recognition" is built using four different algorithms listed below. 
And then these four algorithms were trained and tested with the same data and the corresponding accuracies were calculated.
These accuracies were then compared and the best approach shall be considered for deployment.

Ide:
-------
Google's colab Notebook

Language:
--------------
Python version 3.7

Algorithms used:
-------------------------
1. KNN
2. SVM
3. Decision Trees
4. CNN


Dataset:
------------
Here, we are using MNIST dataset
which is in image file format. 
One which is in a square shaped image 
for training and the other one for testing.


Dependencies/Libraries:
-------------------------------------
1. OpenCV (cv2)
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Sklearn
5. Matplotlib
6. Tensorflow
7. Keras


Steps to run the project:
-------------------------------------
0. Download the folder from the drive 
    link or take it from the pendrive;  
1. Open : colab.research.google.com
    on your chrome.
2. Make sure you have decent internet 
    connection. 
3. Then you will see a page in which click 
    on upload option.
4. Upload the "code.ipynb" file.
5. The you will see the notebook with code.
6. Now on the left side you will have a folder 
    symbol with "Files" option click on that.
    Remember it is "Files" NOT the "File".
7. Wait for the kernel to connect and then 
    you'll see Upload button just below "Files".
8. Click on that upload and upload both the 
    images "digits.png" and "test_digits.png".
9. Now to run this code you will have to run it block
    by block.
10. Remember to run them from the first to last 
    in the sequence one after other so that you 
    don't get any errors.
